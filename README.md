# Alura-ONE

 In this repository, you will find the code of the exercises suggested in the 'Programmation logic' study program by Alura ONE. 

 Mainly, the files found here are the solutions for the exercises that I found more relevant with my take on them added.

## Notes on the file's organization
- Every folder has the name of one of the courses from the program. 
- Inside the course folder, another folder could be found with a name similar to 'AulaX', where X is a number. 
This folder indicates the class the exercises inside are from.
- All the exercises have a description of what they do at the beginning.
- The style of the commits used in this repository indicates the class number. For example, a commit like 'A-5: ...' means 
 that the changes made correspond to the files of the fifth class of a particular course.
